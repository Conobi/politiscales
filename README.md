# PolitiScales
PolitiScale is a political test using 8 ideological values to help you
know approximately where you belong to in the political field, or
simply to share your profile with your friends. It was an initiative of “Radicalisé·e·s sur Internet” which is freely
inspired by [8values](https://8values.github.io/).

In mid-2020, PolitiScales was stopped, so it is now time to fork and enhance the project!

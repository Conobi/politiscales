**Politiscales** is a political test using 8 ideological values to help you know approximately where you belong to in the political field, or simply to share your profile with your friends. This internet website was an initiative of *“Radicalisé·e·s sur Internet”* which is freely inspired by 8values.
In mid-2020, Politiscales was stopped, so it is now time to fork and enhance the project!

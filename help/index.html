			<div class="description">
				<div class="descImg"><img src="/images/constructivism.png" alt="Constructivism"></div>
				<div class="descText">
					<p>Why are the people how they are? This axis allows you to situate yourself between two opposite poles which answer this question.</p>
					<p><strong>Constructivists</strong> consider that people build themselves from their environment (notably social) and that the characteristics that make them who they are, are acquired.</p>
					<p>On the contrary, <strong>essentialists</strong> consider that an individual is by nature how he/she is and that his/her characteristics which make this person who she/he is, are innate.</p>

			<h3>Rehabilitative Justice vs. Punitive Justice</h3>
			<div class="description">
				<div class="descImg"><img src="/images/justice_soft.png" alt="Rehabilitative justice"></div>
				<div class="descText">
					<p>Those in favor of <strong>rehabilitative justice</strong> consider that the role of justice is to put the condemned on the “right path” again by making them understand why they should not do what they did and why they were condemned and by accompanying them all along the process.</p>
					<p>Conversely those in favor of <strong>punitive justice</strong> consider that the role of justice is dissuasive, both for the condemned (to avoid recidivism) and for the rest of the society (by making them examples not to follow).</p>

				<div class="descImg"><img src="/images/progressism.png" alt="Progressism"></div>
				<div class="descText">
					<p>The <strong>progressives</strong> try to build social progress, make a better society without caring about traditions. They often consider the present as better than the past and that it is necessary to keep on this path.</p>
					<p>On the contrary the <strong>conservatives</strong> want to keep the status quo and even to reinsert some values already considered as disappeared or disappearing. Traditions, among those the religious heritage, are put forward as a source of wisdom.</p>

				<div class="descImg"><img src="/images/internationalism.png" alt="Internationalism"></div>
				<div class="descText">

				<div class="descImg"><img src="/images/communism.png" alt="Communism"></div>

				<div class="descImg"><img src="/images/capitalism.png" alt="Capitalism" class="descImgRight"></div>

			<h3>Regulation vs. Laissez-faire</h3>
			<div class="description">
				<div class="descImg"><img src="/images/regulation.png" alt="Regulationnism"></div>
				<div class="descText">
					<p>This axis represents the attitude that a government needs to have concerning the market economy in which an important part of the means of production are private. Liberals and Keynesians are opposed to the method that needs to be adopted without putting into question capitalism. If you are more capitalist, this axis represents your goal in terms of economy. If you are more communist, this axis represents the least bad that you can expect of the current system.</p>
					<p><strong>Regulation</strong> or interventionism is an idea in which the economical activity should be regulated for the common interest. It can be through legislation, planning, subventions, a variable taxation...</p>
					<p>On the contrary, the <strong>laissez-faire</strong> is the ideas in which the economical activity should not be regulated because it would in itself correspond to the common interest. It can be through a weak legislation, few or no subventions, a fixed taxation and often weak or even the complete suppression of the role of the state in the economy.</p>

			<h3>Revolution vs. Reform</h3>
			<div class="description">
				<div class="descImg"><img src="/images/revolution.png" alt="Revolution"></div>
				<div class="descText">
					<p><strong>Revolutionaries</strong> have a tendency to privilege direct action, often in the margin of legality, to reach their goal: replace the current political organization for totally different one.</p>
					<p><strong>Reformers</strong> have a tendency to privilege legal action to reach their goal: reform the political organization step by step. This can be done through the institutions, via elections, authorized demonstrations, petitions...</p>

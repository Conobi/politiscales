              Why are the people how they are? This axis allows you to situate
              yourself between two opposite poles which answer this question.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Constructivists</strong> consider that people build
              themselves from their environment (notably social) and that the
              characteristics that make them who they are, are acquired.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the contrary, <strong>essentialists</strong> consider that an
              individual is by nature how he/she is and that his/her
              characteristics which make this person who she/he is, are innate.
            </p>

        <h3>Rehabilitative Justice vs. Punitive Justice</h3>

          <div class="descText">
            <p>
              Those in favor of <strong>rehabilitative justice</strong> consider
              that the role of justice is to put the condemned on the “right
              path” again by making them understand why they should not do what
              they did and why they were condemned and by accompanying them all
              along the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conversely those in favor of
              <strong>punitive justice</strong> consider that the role of
              justice is dissuasive, both for the condemned (to avoid
              recidivism) and for the rest of the society (by making them
              examples not to follow).

            <p>
              The <strong>progressives</strong> try to build social progress,
              make a better society without caring about traditions. They often
              consider the present as better than the past and that it is
              necessary to keep on this path.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the contrary the <strong>conservatives</strong> want to keep
              the status quo and even to reinsert some values already considered
              as disappeared or disappearing. Traditions, among those the
              religious heritage, are put forward as a source of wisdom.

            <p>
              <strong>Internationalism</strong> is a set of different ides which
              have for common point to stop making a hierarchy between countries
              and their inhabitants and to promote as much as possible their
              cooperation. Pushed to its maximum the final objective is the
              abolitions of borders.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, <strong>nationalism</strong> is a set of
              heterogeneous ideas which, when applied, favor one country and its
              citizens over foreigners, it also justifies the idea that each
              people has a nation

            <p>
              <strong>Communism</strong> is a vast political doctrine. In this
              test a majority for communism simply signifies that you are for a
              public property of the means of production.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Capitalism</strong> is as well an ambivalent concept. In
              this test a majority for capitalism simply signifies that you are
              for a private property of the means of production.

              This axis represents the attitude that a government needs to have
              concerning the market economy in which an important part of the
              means of production are private. Liberals and Keynesians are
              opposed to the method that needs to be adopted without putting
              into question capitalism. If you are more capitalist, this axis
              represents your goal in terms of economy. If you are more
              communist, this axis represents the least bad that you can expect
              of the current system.

              <strong>Regulation</strong> or interventionism is an idea in which
              the economical activity should be regulated for the common
              interest. It can be through legislation, planning, subventions, a
              variable taxation...
            </p>
            <p>
              On the contrary, the <strong>laissez-faire</strong> is the ideas
              in which the economical activity should not be regulated because
              it would in itself correspond to the common interest. It can be
              through a weak legislation, few or no subventions, a fixed
              taxation and often weak or even the complete suppression of the
              role of the state in the economy.

              <strong>Ecology</strong> in politics privileges the protection of
              the environment by limiting as much as possible the impact of
              human activities on the biodiversity even if it implies to limit
              the these human activities by modifying more or less radically our
              current way of life.

            <p>
              <strong>Production</strong> privileges human needs notably by
              supporting the increase of the production or the use of methods
              that have an uncertain impact on the environment.

              goal: replace the current political organization for totally
              different one.
